## About

- Another Assignment that many of my former Rich Media I students will remember is the "Canvas Lorenz Attractor" Vanilla JS assignment:
  - [HW-Lorenz Attractor](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-lorenz-attractor.md)
- I wanted to do a new version of it utilizing Vue.js, TypeScript, Pinia, Vitest, etc - as well as add some new features to the app.
- For this Vue.js version I did not end up adding a lot of new features other than rotation and one additional attractor system (Halvorsen) - so it's not too visually striking yet.
- To do list: add more attractor systems, add more color color functions other than the basic "Hue Ramp", and do something interesting with the background - maybe some kind of automata running in background (Conway's life, reaction diffusion etc)
